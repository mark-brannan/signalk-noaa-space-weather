# Open loops

Work in flight, and only that. Facts go to `docs/`, questions go to an issue,
history goes to `git log` — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#open-loops-live-in-kanbanmd)
for the rules. A card carries a link, the action, and — when it applies —
what it is blocked by. Delete it when it is done.

## Yours

- [ ] Enable **private vulnerability reporting** (Settings → Code security), so
      the advisory link in
      [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
      and the Code of Conduct's enforcement contact both work — only a repo
      admin can turn it on
      ([#106](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/pull/106))

- [ ] Paste the cloud-environment setup blob from
      [dotfiles RUNBOOK](https://github.com/mark-brannan/dotfiles/blob/main/RUNBOOK.md#create-a-cloud-environment)
      into all three Claude Code environments — only the web UI can set it, and
      `Default (with tailscale)` currently has no seed, so sessions there get
      no `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Decide how a session that isn't `claude-review.yml` (Claude Code web,
      mobile, a plain checkout) gets `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — an
      environment-level sync only you can configure
      ([context](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/pull/97#discussion_r3823818406))

## Claude's

- [ ] Fix K-index tile's oversized margins on narrow viewports ([#129](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/issues/129))
- [ ] Make Storm Scales title responsive and align it with the Kp graph ([#130](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/issues/130))
- [ ] Determine the rationale for 3-day R-scale coloring, fix if backwards ([#131](https://github.com/mark-brannan/signalk-noaa-space-weather/issues/131))
